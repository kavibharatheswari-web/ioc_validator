# 🔄 IOC Validator - No Duplicates Update

## ✅ UPDATE APPLIED

**Date**: 2025-10-22  
**Version**: 1.7.2

---

## 🎯 WHAT WAS FIXED

### 1. Dashboard Stat Counts - No Duplicate IOCs

**Issue**: Dashboard counts could include duplicate IOCs

**Solution**: Count only unique IOCs in last 24 hours

**Example**:
```
Before (with duplicates):
- Same IOC analyzed 3 times → counted 3 times
- Critical: 15 (includes duplicates)

After (unique only):
- Same IOC analyzed 3 times → counted 1 time
- Critical: 5 (unique IOCs only)
```

### 2. Dashboard Top 20 - No Duplicate IOCs

**Issue**: Dashboard Top 20 could show same IOC multiple times

**Solution**: Remove duplicates, keep only most recent per IOC

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Remove duplicates - keep only most recent per IOC
const uniqueAnalyses = [];
const seenIOCs = new Set();

for (const analysis of analyses) {
    if (!seenIOCs.has(analysis.ioc)) {
        seenIOCs.add(analysis.ioc);
        uniqueAnalyses.push(analysis);
    }
}

// Then sort and display top 20 unique IOCs
```

## ✅ CONSISTENCY ACROSS APPLICATION

Now all pages have no duplicates:

### Dashboard
- ✅ **Stat Counts**: Unique IOCs only (24h)
- ✅ **Top 20**: No duplicates
- ✅ Most recent per IOC
- ✅ Sorted by severity

### History
- ✅ No duplicates (already implemented)
- ✅ Most recent per IOC
- ✅ Searchable/filterable

### Severity Popups
- ✅ Shows all from last 24h
- ✅ May have duplicates (by design - shows all recent analyses)

---

## 🔧 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### File Modified
- `static/app.js` - `loadDashboard()` function

### Logic for Stat Counts
1. Get all analyses from last 7 days
2. Filter last 24 hours
3. **Remove duplicates from 24h data** (keep most recent per IOC)
4. Count unique IOCs by severity
5. Display counts

### Logic for Top 20
1. Get all analyses from last 7 days
2. **Remove duplicates** (keep most recent per IOC)
3. Sort by severity (Critical → Info)
4. Within severity, sort by score
5. Take top 20 unique IOCs
6. Display

### Lines Changed
- Added: ~20 lines
- Modified: 1 function

## 🧪 TESTING

### Test 1: Dashboard Stat Counts
```
Steps:
1. Analyze same IOC 3 times (e.g., google.com)
2. Go to Dashboard
3. Check stat counts

Expected:
✓ IOC counted only once (not 3 times)
✓ Accurate unique counts
✓ No duplicate counting

Status: [ ]
```

### Test 2: Dashboard Top 20
```
Steps:
1. Analyze same IOC multiple times
2. Go to Dashboard
3. Check Top 20 section

Expected:
✓ IOC appears only once
✓ Most recent analysis shown
✓ No duplicates in list

Status: [ ]
```

### Test: Sorting Still Works
```
Steps:
1. View Dashboard Top 20
2. Verify sorting

Expected:
✓ Critical IOCs first
✓ Then High, Medium, Low, Info
✓ Within severity, highest score first

Status: [ ]
```
