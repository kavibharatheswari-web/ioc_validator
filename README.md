- Local database storage
- Optional API key usage

## AI Model Information

The application uses the following AI capabilities:

### Primary Model
- **DistilGPT2** - Lightweight text generation model from Hugging Face
- Used for threat summarization and recommendations
- Runs locally without external API calls
- Automatic fallback to rule-based analysis if model unavailable

### Zero-Day Detection
- Pattern recognition for unknown threats
- Behavioral analysis of suspicious indicators
- Confidence scoring for novel threats
- Continuous learning from threat intelligence feeds

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. AI Model Loading Error**
```
Warning: Could not load AI model
```
- Solution: The app will use rule-based analysis instead
- Optional: Install torch with CUDA support for GPU acceleration

**2. API Rate Limits**
- Free API keys have rate limits
- Solution: Wait before making more requests or upgrade to paid plans

**3. Database Locked Error**
- Solution: Ensure only one instance of the app is running
- Delete `ioc_validator.db` and restart to reset database

**4. Port Already in Use**
- Solution: Change port in `app.py`: `app.run(port=5001)`

## Performance Optimization

### For Better Performance:
1. **GPU Acceleration**: Install CUDA-enabled PyTorch for faster AI analysis
2. **API Keys**: Configure API keys for more comprehensive results
3. **Batch Size**: Analyze IOCs in batches of 10-20 for optimal speed
4. **Caching**: Results are cached in database to avoid redundant API calls
