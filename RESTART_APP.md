# 🔄 Restart Required

## ✅ Static Files Fix Applied

The Flask app has been updated to properly serve CSS and JavaScript files.

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

**Problem**: CSS and JS files were returning 404 errors

**Solution**: Updated Flask app initialization to properly configure static files

**Change Made**:
```python
# Before
app = Flask(__name__)

# After
app = Flask(__name__, static_folder='static', static_url_path='')
```

---

## 🔄 RESTART THE APPLICATION

### In the terminal where the app is running:

1. **Stop the app**: Press `Ctrl+C`

2. **Restart the app**:
```bash
python app.py
```

Or use the virtual environment:
```bash
./venv/bin/python app.py
```

---

## ✅ After Restart

1. **Refresh your browser**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (hard refresh)
2. **Check**: CSS and JS should now load properly
3. **Test**: All navigation links should work

---

## 🧪 Verify It's Working

You should see in the terminal:
```
127.0.0.1 - - [date/time] "GET /styles.css HTTP/1.1" 200 -
127.0.0.1 - - [date/time] "GET /app.js HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

Instead of:
```
127.0.0.1 - - [date/time] "GET /styles.css HTTP/1.1" 404 -
127.0.0.1 - - [date/time] "GET /app.js HTTP/1.1" 404 -
```

## 📝 Quick Restart Commands

```bash
# In terminal, press Ctrl+C to stop, then:
python app.py

# Or with manage.py:
python manage.py start
```

**Status**: Fix applied, restart required to take effect
