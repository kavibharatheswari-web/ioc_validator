# 🎯 IOC Validator - Scoring & Classification Improvements

## ✅ Updates Applied

**Date**: 2025-10-22  
**Version**: 1.2.0

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ Enhanced Threat Scoring Algorithm

**Problem**: 
- Severity was showing "Info" for clean IOCs (which is correct)
- Scoring didn't properly weight different tool detections
- No visibility into individual tool scores

**Solution**:
- Completely rewrote `calculate_threat_metrics()` function
- Added weighted scoring based on detection types
- Tracks malicious, suspicious, and abuse scores separately
- Provides detection summary with counts

**New Scoring Logic**:
```
Malicious detections: Weight x8 (max 80 points)
Suspicious detections: Weight x3 (max 30 points)
Abuse confidence: Direct score (0-100)
AlienVault pulses: +1-5 points per pulse
URLScan malicious: +10 points
MalwareBazaar found: +10 points
PowerShell High risk: +8 points
PowerShell Medium risk: +5 points
```

### 2. ✅ Improved Severity Classification

**New Classification Rules**:
- **Critical** (Red): Score ≥70 OR malicious ≥5
- **High** (Orange): Score ≥50 OR malicious ≥2
- **Medium** (Blue): Score ≥30 OR suspicious ≥3
- **Low** (Green): Score >0 OR suspicious >0
- **Info** (Gray): Score =0 AND no detections

**Why "Info" is Correct**:
- "Info" severity means the IOC is clean with no threats detected
- This is the expected result for legitimate IPs/domains like google.com, 8.8.8.8
- It's not an error - it's telling you the IOC is safe!

### 3. ✅ Added Detection Summary Display

**New Feature**: Detection Summary Box
Shows in detailed report:
- 🔴 **Malicious Detections**: Count from all tools
- 🟠 **Suspicious Detections**: Count from all tools
- 🔵 **Abuse Confidence**: Highest score from AbuseIPDB
- 🟢 **Tools Checked**: Number of tools that analyzed the IOC

### 4. ✅ Enhanced Tool Results Display

**Improvements**:
- Color-coded scores (red for malicious, orange for suspicious)
- Highlighted important fields
- Better formatting for links
- Risk levels color-coded
- Abuse scores color-coded by severity

**Color Coding**:
- **Red**: Malicious detections, high abuse (>75%)
- **Orange**: Suspicious detections, medium abuse (50-75%)
- **Blue**: Low abuse (<50%)
- **Green**: Clean/low risk

## 📊 Understanding Severity Levels

### Critical (🔴 Red)
- **Threat Score**: 70-100
- **OR Malicious Count**: ≥5 detections
- **Meaning**: Confirmed malicious, immediate action required
- **Example**: Known malware, C&C servers, phishing sites

### High (🟠 Orange)
- **Threat Score**: 50-69
- **OR Malicious Count**: 2-4 detections
- **Meaning**: Likely malicious, investigation required
- **Example**: Suspicious domains, reported IPs

### Medium (🟡 Yellow/Blue)
- **Threat Score**: 30-49
- **OR Suspicious Count**: ≥3 detections
- **Meaning**: Potentially malicious, monitoring required
- **Example**: New domains, suspicious patterns

### Low (🟢 Green)
- **Threat Score**: 1-29
- **OR Suspicious Count**: 1-2 detections
- **Meaning**: Minor indicators, low risk
- **Example**: Flagged by single tool

### Info (⚪ Gray)
- **Threat Score**: 0
- **AND No Detections**: Clean
- **Meaning**: No threats detected, appears safe
- **Example**: google.com, 8.8.8.8, legitimate sites
